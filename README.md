### User Goals
Users of Redo aim to:

* Post News: Share their own news articles, updates, and stories with the platform's community.
* Discover News: Explore a variety of news articles on topics of interest from different sources.
* Connect with Others: Interact with fellow users by commenting on posts, liking content, and sharing articles.

### User Stories
* As a user who wants to share news, I want to create an account, log in, and post my news articles to share them with the community.
* As a user looking to connect, I want to leave comments on posts that resonate with me and follow other users whose content I find valuable.
* As a user in search of specific information, I want to use the search bar to quickly find posts related to particular topics or from specific users.
* As a user interested in current events, I want to scroll through a feed of diverse news articles and click on ones that intrigue me for more details.
### Site owner Goals
* Keep users interested: Make a fun platform where people enjoy spending time and talking to each other.

* Get more friends: Help the community grow by getting more people to join and take part.
* Make people happy: Keep making the site better based on what people say, so they like using it.
### Design Choices
#### Font
[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) is a clean and modern font that's perfect for any website. It's easy to read on screens of all sizes, making it ideal for web and mobile use.
#### Icons
I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons because they're easy to use and look great. After adding them to the site, it became livelier and more attractive. Thanks to them, the website is easier to read. They are easy to understand, so they replace some descriptions.
#### Colours
Redo features a stylish and adaptable color scheme:

* Dark Theme: The default dark theme offers a sleek and modern aesthetic
* Light Theme: For user comfort and preference, Redo also provides a light theme option

#### Structure
The project is structured into the following main components:

* Home Page: Users are greeted with a feed of the latest news articles posted by the community. The user-friendly interface encourages users to explore and engage.

* User Accounts: Users can create accounts, log in, and personalize their profiles. Profiles include a profile picture, bio, and a list of posts authored by the user.

* News Feed: The heart of the platform, the news feed displays posts from various users, allowing readers to discover news articles that align with their interests.

* Post Interaction: Users can interact with posts by leaving comments, liking content, and sharing articles to other platforms.

* Search Functionality: A convenient search bar enables users to find specific posts or profiles efficiently.
